CedarRapidsOnline

This is a web application built using
 * Python
 * CherryPy
 * PostgreSQL
 * PyGreSQL

The application serves as an online learning community aimed at current and
future residents of Cedar Rapids, Iowa.  The overall structure is based on
the systems described in Software Engineering for Internet Applications
(http://philip.greenspun.com/seia/)

This software was written by Trevis Rothwell (tjr@gnu.org) and is released
and reusable under the GNU GPL v3 license (or, at your option, any later
version of the GNU GPL).

As of this checkin (14 November 2009) this software is incomplete and unusable
as a full working system.
