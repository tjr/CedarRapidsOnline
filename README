CedarRapidsOnline

This is a web application built using
 * Python
 * CherryPy
 * PostgreSQL
 * PyGreSQL

The application serves as an online learning community aimed at current and
future residents of Cedar Rapids, Iowa.  The overall structure is based on
the systems described in Software Engineering for Internet Applications
(http://philip.greenspun.com/seia/)

This software was written by Trevis Rothwell (tjr@gnu.org) and is released
and reusable under the GNU GPL v3 license (or, at your option, any later
version of the GNU GPL).

As of this checkin (21 November 2009) this software is a working system, with
some minor issues yet to be addressed / implemented.

SETUP
 * Create a PostgreSQL database using the included SQL definitions.
 * Modify the site.conf file as needed
 * Modify the pageutils.py file as needed (specifically, insert correct
   database information)
 * Modify index.py to include the IP address of your system

 * Run: python index.py
 * Load the site in your browser
 * Create a new user as the admin user
 * Using PostgreSQL psql, set the new user's level to 2
 * Create a "welcome" page that serves as the main index content
 * Create a "map" page that serves as the article index

TODO
 * Create admin pages for editing users
 * Make first user default to being admin user
 * Fix all "FIXME" code blocks, including adding better error reporting.
 * Create a basic install script that handles creation of "welcome" and
   "map" pages, along with whatever else can/should be install-scripted.
 * Some sections of code could be cleaned up, refactored.
